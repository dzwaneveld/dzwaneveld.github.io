These templates were originally created for personal use, but with lacking easy-to-use report and article templates by TU Delft, they are now available publicly. The design principle of these templates is to be extensive, but simple. Whether you are only changing the bibliography style, making changes to the title page, or wanting to have full control over the layout, these templates are made to make that easier.
