Welcome! This is the documentation for the improved TU Delft LaTeX report/thesis and article template, last updated on April 10, 2021. The design principle of these templates is to be simple *and* extensive. Whether you are only changing the bibliography style, making major changes to the title page, or wanting to have full control over the layout, these templates aim to make that easier. Both templates are available under [CC BY-NC 4.0](/about.html). If you have suggestions or encounter issues, feel free to [contact me](/about.html#contact).
