Welcome! This is the documentation for the simplified and improved TU Delft LaTeX report/thesis and article templates. With lacking easy-to-use report, thesis and article templates by Delft University of Technology, these personal templates are now available publicly. The main design principle of these templates is to be simple and extensive. Whether you are only interested in changing the style of the bibliography, making major changes to the title page or want to have full control over the layout, these templates aim to make that easier. Even if you are not interested in making any changes, these templates include a careful selection of common packages to get started immediately and are ready-to-go when it comes to the document and file structure.

The report/thesis and article templates are available under CC BY-NC 4.0. See [here](/license.html) for more information. No attribution is required in PDF outputs created using this template. Feel free to [contact me](/contact.html) with questions, suggestions or issues related to the templates or this documentation.
