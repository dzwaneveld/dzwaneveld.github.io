This template works with _pdfLaTeX_, _XeLaTeX_ and _LuaLaTeX_. In order to adhere to the TU Delft house style, either _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_ is required, as it supports TrueType and OpenType fonts. _BibLaTeX_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _biber_. If you would like to use it on Overleaf, click the button above to get started immediately.

::: tip Frequently Asked Questions
On this page, you will find a general outline of the template. If you have specific questions, you might want to visit the [FAQ](/report/faq.html) instead.

## 1. Document Structure

### 1.1 Global Options

As a report/thesis is generally quite a substantial document, the chapters and appendices have been separated into different files for convenience. All these files are inserted in the master file, `report.tex`, using the `\input{filename}` command. The document class, which can be found in `layout/tudelft-report.cls`, is based on the LaTeX book class. The class currently accepts one custom option:

- **Twoside**: If this option is specified, minor changes the margins and headers are made and whitepages are added to resemble a printed (doublesided) book/report layout. In case the document is not printed, it is recommended to keep using the `oneside` option, as any obsolete whitepages will be removed.

The default option can be changed to the option mentioned above by adding the option to the first line in the master file:

```LaTeX
\documentclass[<option1>,<option2>,...]{layout/tudelft-report}
```

### 1.2 Structure

Between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`, the content is split into three parts by:

- `\frontmatter`, which uses Roman numerals for the page numbers and is used for the title page, table of contents, nomenclature and list of tables and figures. The title page can be found in `titlepage.tex` and the nomenclature in `nomenclature.tex`. The nomenclature uses *longtables* by default, which allows tables to flow over page boundaries;

- `\mainmatter`, which uses Arabic numerals for the page numbers and is used for the chapters. The bibliography is added using `\printbibliography` using the file `report.bib`. See [Section 3](/report/getting-started.html#_3-bibliography) for more details.

- `\appendix`, which uses letters for the chapters.

## 2. Cover and Title Page

### 2.1 Information on the Cover and Title Page

This template will automatically generate a cover when using the `\makecover` command. Before generating the cover, some information has to be specified:

- **Required:** `\title{Title}`, `\author{Author}`, `\coverimage{cover.jpg}}`\
These commands specify the title, author and cover image respectively. Make the title concise and add more information in the optional subtitle. As the space is limited, the title page includes a table to specify student names and numbers when working in a larger group.

- **Optional:** `\subtitle{Subtitle}`, `\subject{Course Code: Name}`\
The subtitle and subject are optional. It is recommended to make the subtitle two lines. The subtitle supports linebreaks (\\\\) to fine-tune if desired.

The title, subtitle and author will also be present on the title page. To give greater flexibility over the title page, the layout is described in `title.tex`. Modify this file according to your needs and make sure to check the requirements.

### 2.2 Included Cover Images

Six high quality images related to aerospace engineering have been included in this template. Make sure to appropriately credit them, if you decide to use one of them. A preview can be found below, together with the attributions.

  <img align="centre"  src="./img/covers.jpg" alt="Cover Image Examples" width="400" />
</p>

For the first three images, the title color `4884d6` is recommended:

* `cover1.jpg`: Storm Cell Over the Southern Appalachian Mountains by NASA/Stu Broce under CC BY 2.0
* `cover2.jpg`: Canadarm 2 Robotic Arm Grapples SpaceX Dragon by NASA under CC BY-NC 2.0 // Modified
* `cover3.jpg`: City Lights of Africa, Europe, and the Middle East by NASA Earth Observatory under CC BY 2.0

For fourth, the title color `fe860e` is recommended. For the final two, the title color `e3a01b` is recommended:

* `cover4.jpg`: Royal Air Force Voyager Transport Tanker Aircraft by Ministry of Defense/Cpl Ashley Keates under OGL v1.0
* `cover5.jpg`: Aircraft Flying in the Sunset by Gerhard Gellinger
* `cover6.jpg`: F18 at Bodo Air Base Norway by Ministerio de Defensa Espa√±a under CC BY-NC 2.0

## 3. Bibliography

The bibliography is added using `\printbibliography` using the file `report.bib` and has been renamed to 'References' using the `title=References` option. If you would like to change the default bibliography file, change the command `\addbibresource{report.bib}` accordingly, which can be found in the class file.

Some examples of common types of references can be found in the bibliography file. Remember that, especially articles, often have 'cite using BibTeX' available. An example of a book entry can be found below. In this case, the entry can be cited using `\cite{anderson-introduction-to-flight}`. This command accepts multiple entries, separated by a comma (`\cite{entry1,entry2,...}`).

```LaTeX
@book{anderson-introduction-to-flight,
    Author = {J.D. Anderson},
    Title = {Introduction to Flight},
    Publisher = {McGraw Hill Education},
    Year = {2016},
    Edition = {8th international ed.},
    Address = {New York, United States},
    Note = {}
}
```

Adding most entries will be relatively straightforward, however some uncommon types will inevitably appear at times. Refer to [Section 2.1.1](http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf#subsubsection.2.1.1) of the documentation of BibLaTeX to learn more about the various default types and the fields accepted per type.
