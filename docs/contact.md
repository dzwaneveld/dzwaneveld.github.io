# LaTeX Ã— TU Delft

## Contact

::: tip Note as of August 2024
As I have moved on from the TU Delft for a few years now and I am currently studying at the University of Groningen, I have unfortunately decided to be more selective in answering questions. I would still be happy to hear from you, but please keep the following in mind:

- If you are encountering issues, make sure these issues also exist in a 'clean' template. Start by creating a new document and gradually incorporate the key elements of what you are trying to achieve. Attempt to isolate the issue as much as possible.
-  Have you isolated the issue, and it appears to be an issue with the template? I would appreciate to hear about the issue to make sure no one else will be encountering the same problems. 
- Are you trying to change the layout and/or fonts of the template completely? I will not be able to help you. A few small changes are completely fine though, as the template is built with this in mind.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!

Feel free to contact me with questions, suggestions or issues related to the templates or this documentation. You can send an email to [dzwaneveld.github.io@gmail.com](mailto:dzwaneveld.github.io@gmail.com) or create an issue in the appropriate repository ([Report/Thesis Template](https://github.com/dzwaneveld/tudelft-report-thesis-template) / [Article Template](https://github.com/dzwaneveld/tudelft-article-template) / [Documentation](https://github.com/dzwaneveld/dzwaneveld.github.io)). 

## Donate

With the TU Delft having abandoned their official LaTeX templates, I decided to rewrite the report/thesis template from scratch. Once a template shared with a few friends, now a properly documented template. Although I am currently studying at the University of Groningen, I am still maintaining these templates _without any input from the TU Delft_. Accepting donations is merely an afterthought. If you would like to support this personal project however, you can do so via bank transfer: `NL90ABNA0540801100` (BIC: `ABNANL2A`). If you are living in the Netherlands and would rather donate by iDEAL, send me an email.
