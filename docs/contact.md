## Donate

With the TU Delft having abandoned their official LaTeX templates, I decided to rewrite the report/thesis template from scratch. Once a template shared with a few friends, now a properly documented template. Although I am now studying at the University of Groningen, I am still maintaining these templates and answerings questions.
