# LaTeX Templates for Delft University of Technology

This is the source code of the documentation for the unofficial TU Delft LaTeX report/thesis and article template, which you can find [here](https://dzwaneveld.github.io). The design principle of these templates is to be simple *and* extensive. Whether you are only changing the bibliography style, making major changes to the title page, or wanting to have full control over the layout, these templates aim to make that easier.

The templates and documentation are by no means perfect. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, let me know here:
