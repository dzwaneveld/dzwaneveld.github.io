# LaTeX Templates for Delft University of Technology

This is the source code of the documentation for the unofficial TU Delft LaTeX report/thesis and article template, which you can find [here](https://dzwaneveld.github.io). The design principle of these templates is to be extensive, but simple. Whether you are only changing the bibliography style, making changes to the title page, or wanting to have full control over the layout, these templates are made to make that easier. 

The templates and documentation is by no means perfect. If you have suggestions or encounter issues, let me know here:
